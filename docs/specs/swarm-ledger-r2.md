# Swarm-training MVP — lane R2 ledger (peer-side round engine / checkpointing / gossip)

Wave-2 coordination record for lane **R2** (`swarm/r2`). Companion to the program ledger
[`swarm-mvp-ledger.md`](swarm-mvp-ledger.md) ("Merge 1 — frozen interfaces") and the Wave-1
runtime record [`swarm-ledger-r1.md`](swarm-ledger-r1.md). Read those first for the frozen seams
(`daemon-swarm-proto` API, `SwarmTransport`, `TrainerBackend`, worker protocol) and the
frozen-file rule. This file records what R2 builds on top of those seams, the new seams it exports
(frozen at Merge 2), and every `MERGE-2` marker Merge 2 must resolve.

## Base + branch

- **Branch:** `swarm/r2`, forked from `c1432fa` (`mirror(merge-1): freeze cross-lane interfaces`)
  on `integrations/swarm` — Merge 1, all Wave-1 lanes (P1/R1/E1) integrated.
- **Merge target:** `integrations/swarm` (disjoint file set → conflict-free by construction).
- **Owns (create / edit only within):** `crates/swarm/daemon-swarm-net`,
  `crates/swarm/daemon-swarm-run`, `crates/coprocessor/daemon-train-client`, and the `tests/`
  swarm e2e surface (`tests/daemon-swarm-e2e/`).

## FROZEN — do not touch (single-writer rule)

Root `Cargo.toml`, `deny.toml`, `flake.nix`; the Merge-1 frozen seams (`daemon-swarm-proto` API,
`SwarmTransport` traits, `TrainerBackend` trait, worker protocol message set). Extend the frozen
seams **additively only**. Other lanes' directories (coordinator/observe/proto/det-core/train-sdk/
train/guests/xtask) are out of bounds.

## Parallel-lane note (P2 coordinator)

Lane P2 builds the coordinator pure-tick state machine + deterministic assignment **in parallel**;
its API is **not** available to R2. The peer-side round engine here is built directly against the
frozen Wave-1 proto message types (`RoundOpen`/`Commitment`/`Attestation`/`StorageReceipt`/
`RoundRecord`/`Digest`/`Straggle`). Every place that would consume a real coordinator drives a
**TEST-ONLY scripted coordinator** fixture (a hardcoded/scripted message sequence over
`LoopbackGossip`), clearly marked `// MERGE-2: replace with daemon-swarm-coordinator tick loop`.
R2 does **not** build a general coordinator.

## Scope (this wave)

| Slice | Crate | Spec | TDD |
|---|---|---|---|
| Reusable control-plane `Deduper` (blake3) | `daemon-swarm-net` | §7.1 | NET-6 |
| Payload fetch fallback (backoff + alternate locators) | `daemon-swarm-net` | §7.1 | NET-4 |
| Reconverging `StubBackend` (round-base outer step) | `daemon-swarm-run` | §5.6, §6.4 | (round-loop oracle) |
| Peer-side `RoundEngine` (round protocol, barrier, stall ladder) | `daemon-swarm-run` | §6.4 | RUN-1..5, RUN-8 |
| Round-boundary checkpoint + desync replay resync | `daemon-swarm-run` | §9, §5.6 | RUN-6/7 subset |
| `harness` (peers + scripted coordinator) | `daemon-swarm-run` | §6.4 | (e2e support) |
| Stub e2e (N=3 × 20 rounds, stall+catchup, deterministic) | `tests/daemon-swarm-e2e` | §6.4, §19.5 | P0 milestone (Merge 2) |

## Seams R2 exports (freeze at Merge 2)

- **`RoundEngine`** (`daemon_swarm_run::engine`) — an async peer-side round state machine
  constructed over `ControlPlane` + `PayloadStore` + `TrainerBackend` + the node ed25519
  `SigningKey`, plus an `EngineConfig` and an event sink. It drives one peer through rounds and
  emits an `EngineEvent` outcome stream. Signature (verbatim below).
- **Checkpoint types** (`daemon_swarm_run::checkpoint`) — `CheckpointManifest { round, blake3,
  digest }`, `Checkpointer`, and the `resync` replay hook.
- **The e2e harness shape** (`daemon_swarm_run::harness`, `feature = "harness"`) — the in-process
  peer set + the `ScriptedCoordinator` fixture. This is the shape the Merge-2 P0 milestone test
  keeps, swapping the scripted coordinator for the real `daemon-swarm-coordinator` tick loop.

### `RoundEngine` API (the seam to watch)

```rust
pub struct EngineConfig {
    pub run: RunId,
    pub roster: Vec<PeerId>,        // frozen for the epoch; sorted internally (I3 order)
    pub witnesses: Vec<PeerId>,     // whose Attestations count (§6.4); default = roster
    pub steps_per_round: u32,
    pub micro_batch: u32,
    pub seq_len: u32,
    pub stall_rounds_max: u32,      // §6.4 rung 2 budget (default 2)
    pub digest_block_size: u32,     // §5.6 sampling granularity
    pub digest_sample_count: u32,
    pub checkpoint_every_rounds: u32,   // 0 = round-boundary checkpoints off
    pub retry: RetryPolicy,         // payload fetch backoff (NET-4)
    pub version: SwarmProtoVersion,
}

pub enum EngineEvent {
    Committed { round: RoundId, hash: ContentHash },
    Attested  { round: RoundId, root: Root, count: u32 },
    RoundComplete { round: RoundId, digest: StateDigest },
    Straggling { round: RoundId, status: StraggleStatus },
    CaughtUp { round: RoundId, digest: StateDigest },
    Checkpointed { round: RoundId, manifest: CheckpointManifest },
    Left { round: RoundId, reason: String },
}

impl<C: ControlPlane, P: PayloadStore, B: TrainerBackend> RoundEngine<C, P, B> {
    pub fn new(control: Arc<C>, store: Arc<P>, backend: B, key: SigningKey,
               cfg: EngineConfig, events: mpsc::UnboundedSender<EngineEvent>) -> Self;
    pub async fn run(&mut self) -> Result<RunOutcome, SwarmRunError>;
}

pub enum RunOutcome { Finished { last_round: RoundId }, LeftForEpoch { round: RoundId } }
```

The engine subscribes to the control plane at construction. `run()` is the message-driven loop:
`RoundOpen(r)` → derive interval → train (`train_step` × micro-batches → `inner_update` per inner
step → `make_update`) → PUT payload → publish signed `Commitment`; prefetch + blake3-verify peers'
payloads as `Commitment`s arrive (witnesses also publish `Attestation` over their fetch-verified
set); `RoundRecord(r)` is the **barrier** — verify the committed set against the record root, stage
in record order (node-pubkey bytes, I3), `ingest` → `Digest`; then round-boundary checkpoint. The
loop terminates on a sentinel `RoundRecord` with `round == u64::MAX` (scripted-coordinator "done")
or on stall-budget exhaustion.

## Design decisions (not obvious from the code)

- **`StubBackend` now reconverges (DiLoCo-shape outer step).** The Wave-1 `StubBackend::ingest`
  folded staged payloads into *current* params, so two peers that trained on different windows
  produced different post-ingest digests — the round-loop "equal digest each round" property
  (§5.6) could never hold. R2 refactors the stub to the spec's agree-path shape: a `base` snapshot
  (the consensus round base, ABI §5.9) is the outer-step anchor; `make_update` emits this peer's
  delta relative to `base`; `ingest` sets `params = base ⊕ orderedFold(staged)` then re-snapshots
  `base`. Because `base` is equal across peers post-ingest and the committed set (record order) is
  equal, the digest is equal every round — while local training still legitimately diverges
  `params` between barriers. Ordering-sensitivity and determinism (the `record_ordering.rs`
  cross-crate I3 test) are preserved. The `TrainerBackend` **trait** is untouched (frozen).
- **Barrier (I2) via a single-task engine.** The engine owns `&mut backend` and processes control
  messages sequentially, so the first `train_step` of round r+1 cannot begin until `ingest(r)`
  returns — the barrier is structural, not advisory. `RoundOpen(r+1)` ships with `RoundRecord(r)`
  and is queued behind the record in the subscription, so it is handled strictly after ingest.
- **Fetch/compute overlap is swarm-level + reactive.** Overlap is realized by the async runtime
  interleaving peers' tasks: while peer A trains round r, peers B/C are committing and A prefetches
  their payloads reactively as `Commitment`s arrive (verified on receipt, cached), so the barrier
  usually finds the set already local. A dedicated per-peer concurrent fetch task (true
  fs/network parallelism *inside* one peer while it computes) is deferred — with the fast
  `FsPayloadStore` it buys nothing, and it would add nondeterminism to the digest transcript.
  `// MERGE-2`: revisit a spawned fetch task once the real iroh/r2 payload plane makes in-peer
  fetch latency material (Wave 3).
- **Local equal-split assignment.** The engine derives a peer's `BatchInterval` from
  `(RoundOpen.batch, roster index)` with a deterministic contiguous equal split.
  `// MERGE-2`: replace with `daemon-swarm-coordinator`'s throughput-weighted deterministic
  assignment (§6.3, PROTO-8); the split site is isolated in `engine::assignment`.
- **Desync detection input.** The record does not carry a consensus digest (each peer emits its
  own `Digest`). R2's resync hook takes an explicit expected/quorum digest (supplied by the
  harness/observer); the replay itself is spec-faithful (checkpoint reload + record/payload replay,
  I1). `// MERGE-2`: wire the quorum-digest source from `daemon-swarm-observe` / the coordinator's
  digest tally.

## MERGE-2 marker sites (search `MERGE-2` in the tree)

| Site | What Merge 2 must do |
|---|---|
| `daemon-swarm-run/src/harness.rs` `ScriptedCoordinator` | swap for the real `daemon-swarm-coordinator` tick loop; the harness peer-set shape stays |
| `tests/daemon-swarm-e2e/tests/*.rs` | swap scripted coordinator → real tick loop (becomes the P0 milestone test) |
| `daemon-swarm-run/src/engine.rs` `assignment` | replace equal-split with coordinator deterministic assignment (§6.3) |
| `daemon-swarm-run/src/engine.rs` fetch overlap note | consider a spawned in-peer fetch task once the network payload plane lands |
| `daemon-swarm-run/src/checkpoint.rs` resync quorum digest | wire the consensus-digest source (observe/coordinator tally) |

## Things Merge 2 / later waves must watch for

- **`tests/*` is a workspace-member glob**, so `tests/daemon-swarm-e2e/` is picked up with **no**
  root `Cargo.toml` edit — the e2e landed as its own crate (the preferred R1 plan location), not as
  a fallback integration test inside `daemon-swarm-run`. It depends on `daemon-swarm-run` with the
  `harness` feature.
- **The `harness` feature** on `daemon-swarm-run` gates the reusable in-process peer harness +
  scripted coordinator (test-fixture code kept out of the default build). Additive; no frozen-file
  change. The e2e crate and any Merge-2 milestone test enable it.
- **Payload fetch fallback (NET-4)** is a store-list + bounded backoff (`fetch_with_fallback`);
  only the `File`/`Fs` plane exists, so the test uses a second `FsPayloadStore` as the fallback
  source. Alternate locators from the `Commitment` (`BlobTicket`) await the iroh-blobs plane.
- **`Deduper` (NET-6)** is now a reusable type; `LoopbackGossip` composes it. Any future control
  plane (WS, iroh gossip) reuses the same content-hash dedupe rather than re-implementing it.
- **Additive-only extension** of the frozen seams remains the rule; the `RoundEngine` /
  checkpoint / harness seams above freeze at Merge 2.
