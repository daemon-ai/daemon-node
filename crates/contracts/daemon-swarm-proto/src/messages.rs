//! The swarm control-plane messages (spec §6.4, §7.3; TDD PROTO-19).
//!
//! The seven round messages — `RoundOpen`, `Commitment`, `Attestation`, `StorageReceipt`,
//! `RoundRecord`, `Digest`, `Straggle` — plus the `Join`/`Heartbeat` envelope messages. Every one
//! travels as **signed CBOR**: the [`SignedMessage`] frame carries the [`SwarmProtoVersion`], the
//! externally-tagged [`SwarmMessage`] payload, the signer's [`PeerId`], and an ed25519
//! [`Signature`] over the canonical CBOR of `(version, payload)`.
//!
//! Attestations and records carry **commitments to sets** ([`SetCommitment`]), not the sets
//! themselves, so the consensus messages are scale-invariant (constant-size at any roster, spec
//! §6.4). The full set may ride alongside as an `inline` list while rosters are small — a transport
//! optimization, never the signed field.
